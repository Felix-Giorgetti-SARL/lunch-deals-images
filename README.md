# Lunch-deals-images

## Scope
Simplify the update of the Lunch deals screens on the zebrix platform

## How
Zebrix will display web pages that are generated using this repo and Github Pages.
Admins will export updated images from Adobe XD to this repo and then Lunch deals will be updated in Zebrix.

In order to simplify the Git commands, admins will use a Quick Action on the local folder that will run all the git pull, git commit, git push etc. in once.
